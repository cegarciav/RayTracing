# RayTracing ECL 2020

This repository contains the developed code in the context of the course Computer Graphics at Ã‰cole Centrale Lyon. The code is strongly based on the tutorial of the course, which is available in the next link : https://www.youtube.com/user/WhitAngl/videos
It's based as well on classroom teaching lessons given by Mr Nicolas Bonneel.

It's possible to find a report with a summary of the achieved effects in this repository.

Concerning the organisation of the code, each folder corresponds to a section of the report. However, here is a summary of the contents of each folder:

TD1: point light source, direct lighting, and spheres<br>
TD2: shades, transparencies, mirror surfaces, and gamma correction<br>
TD3: indirect lighting<br>
TD4: extensive light sources, anti-aliasing, and depth of focus<br>
TD5: meshes, Phong's smoothing, and median filter<br>
TD6: textures, Phong's BRDF, and Fresnel reflexion<br>
